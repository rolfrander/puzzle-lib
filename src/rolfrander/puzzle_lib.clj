(defn a-star 
  "Find the shortest path from start to goal, given a heuristic.
   If the heruistic is admissible (never overestimates 
   the actual distance), a-star is guaranteed to find the shortest path. If the heuristic is consistent, a-star is
   optimally efficient. Consistent means that h(x) â‰¤ d(x, y) + h(y).
   
   * Start is the start-node, 
   * `goal?` is a function taking one parameter returning true if the goal is reached
   * `heurictic-fn` is a function returning the assumed distance from a node to the destination
   * `paths-fn` take a node as input and returns the possible paths out of that node
   * `neightbour-fn` takes a node and a path as input and returns the target-node of that path
   * `dist-fn` takes a path as input and returns the distand for that path
   * `result-type` is `:path` for returning the nodes traveled through, `:count` for returning the number 
     of nodes, `:last` for returning the last node or `:dist` for returning the shortest known distance from start to goal.
   
   the `paths-fn` can be omitted, then the `neighbour-fn` should take as input a node and return all neighbour-nodes, and
   the `dist-fn` should take two neighbouring nodes as input and return the distance between them. This is the canonical 
   version of the algorithm documented on wikipedia.

   if `puzzle-lib/*debug*` is set to true, the algorithm will report the current longest distance as it goes.

(defn neighbours-fn
  "Creates a function for calculating neighbours in a grid.
   All of the explanations assume that coordinates are `[x y]` (that is, the first coordinate moves in the east-west-direction), but
   this doesn't really matter for the calculations. The hex-ns and hex-ew are equal but with axes reversed.
   
   Grid-type is one of:
   * `:sq-4` neighbours are north, south, east, west
   * `:sq-8` as fort `sq-4`, but also diagonals nw, sw, ne, se
   * `:hex-ns-str` grid of 6-sided tiles where it is possible to move straight north or south
   * `:hex-ew-str` as above, but where the straight movements are east and west
   * `:hex-ns-alt` y-lines are squiggly instead of straight NE
   * `:hex-ew-alt` x-lines are squiggly inste3ad fo straight NE

   Border defines what happens when reaching the end of the map:
   * `:infinite` means there is no end
   * `:ignore` means positions larger than max-dim or smaller than 0 are ignored
   * `:wrap` means wrapping around from max-dim to 0
   
   Max-dim is an array of maximum values in each dimension (note that maximum is interpreted differently in :ignore and :wrap).
   Must be specified if border is not `:infinite`.
   
   Dimensions is the number of dimensions. Supported values are 2, 3, 4. Only works for square grids."
