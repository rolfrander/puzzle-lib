  "Find shortest path.
   For all nodes, find the shortest path from source to destination. 
   Nodes is a collection of nodes. Source is the start-node.
   Neighbour-fn takes one parameter, v, and returns all neighbours of v. If all nodes
   are not known beforehand, use a-star instead.

   Optional parameters:
   * weight-fn takes two paramenters, u and v, and returns the distance from u to v. 
   Both u and v are taken from nodes. Default is for all weights to be 1.
   * result-type is :dist :prev or :both, specifying returning distance, path or both
   * dest? is a test to whether the destination is reached. If not specified, 
   all distances and all paths are returned"

(defn a-star
  "Find the shortest path from start to goal, given a heuristic.
   If the heruistic is admissible (never overestimates 
   the actual distance), a-star is guaranteed to find the shortest path. If the heuristic is consistent, a-star is
   optimally efficient. Consistent means that h(x) â‰¤ d(x, y) + h(y).
   
   * Start is the start-node, 
   * `goal?` is a function taking one parameter returning true if the goal is reached
   * `heurictic-fn` is a function returning the assumed distance from a node to the destination
   * `paths-fn` take a node as input and returns the possible paths out of that node
   * `neightbour-fn` takes a node and a path as input and returns the target-node of that path
   * `dist-fn` takes a path as input and returns the distand for that path
   * `result-type` is `:path` for returning the nodes traveled through, `:count` for returning the number 
     of nodes, `:last` for returning the last node or `:dist` for returning the shortest known distance from start to goal.
   
   the `paths-fn` can be omitted, then the `neighbour-fn` should take as input a node and return all neighbour-nodes, and
   the `dist-fn` should take two neighbouring nodes as input and return the distance between them. This is the canonical 
   version of the algorithm documented on wikipedia.

   if `puzzle-lib/*debug*` is set to true, the algorithm will report the current longest distance as it goes.
